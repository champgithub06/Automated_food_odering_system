Automated Food Ordering System README
--------------------------------------

Description:
------------
This project implements three different process scheduling algorithms - Shortest-Job First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Priority Scheduling - in an automated food ordering system. These algorithms aim to minimize customer waiting time and turnaround time by efficiently managing food orders.

Features:
---------
- Shortest-Job First (SJF) Scheduling
- Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling
- Priority Scheduling

Usage:
------
1. Compile the source code.
2. Run the executable.
3. Choose one of the scheduling algorithms from the menu.
4. Follow the prompts to input order details.
5. View the scheduling results and average metrics.

Menu Options:
-------------
1. Shortest-Job First Scheduling
2. Shortest-Remaining Time First Scheduling
3. Priority Scheduling
4. Exit
